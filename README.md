## Instructions

1. Install fish, obviously
0. Install [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) for fish (optional)
0. Install [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) (I think AUR works for arch based systems)
0. Install [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) with fisher (or manually)
0. Configure (the basic stuff) with tide's configuration utility
0. Copy `config.fish` contents from this repo to your local `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
